# ATHENA: a GPU-based Framework for Biomedical 3D Rigid Image Registration
This repository contains the code relative the publication "ATHENA: a GPU-based Framework for Biomedical 3D Rigid Image Registration" at BioCAS 2023

## Testing Environment
1. We tested the code on linux-based machines, on CPUs such as AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, Intel i7-10870H, Intel i7-7700HQ, Intel i7-6700, and Intel Xeon Platinum 8167M; we tested GPUs such as NVIDIA RTX A5000, NVIDIA GTX 1650 Ti, NVIDIA GTX 1050, NVIDIA GTX 960, and NVIDIA Tesla V100.
2. We used python 3.8.10 with `pydicom` `cv2` `numpy` `pandas` `torch` `kornia` `argparse` `statistics` packets 
3. Data used in this publication were generated by the National Cancer Institute Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC).https://doi.org/10.7937/k9/tcia.2018.pat12tbs. Patient: C3N-00704, Study: Dec 10, 2000 NM PET 18 FDG SKULL T, CT: WB STND, PET: WB 3D AC)
4. The 1+1 code takes inspiration from [ITK code](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK)

## Code organization
* `*.py` python source code for the 1+1 or Powell's optimizations procedures, for output evaluation, and for robustness analysis.
* `run_script.sh` automation script to run extensive tests for both CPU and CUDA-based platforms.
* `robustness.sh` automation script to run extensive robustness analysis for our CUDA-based platform.
